This is my own fun little project. I mostly use it to learn languages (Python, to master JS, Go, Ruby, ...)

I won't apologize for some of these; I wrote them as I was developing as a hacker. The amount of skill applied to these problems varies greatly.

To get problem_data importing to work, please run set_paths (from any directory you like) to create the proper files. After running, be sure to source your ~/.bash_profle
