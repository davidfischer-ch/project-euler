![Leonhard Euler](/euler_main.jpg?raw=true "Leonhard Euler with funny hat")

This is my own fun little project. I mostly use it to learn
languages (Python, to master JS, Go, Ruby, ...)

I won't apologize for some of these; I wrote them as I was
developing as a hacker. The amount of skill applied to these
problems varies greatly.

To get `problem_data` importing to work, please run `package_setup`
(from any directory you like) to create the proper files.
After running, be sure to
```
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```
